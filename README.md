# Higure.wtf setup
This is a setup script for https://github.com/Higure-wtf/ . It's based on https://setup.elixr.host and config values are explained in there.
## Running
You can download the script and run it, but a faster way to do it is to run this:
```bash
curl "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GGORG0/higure-wtf-setup/master/setup.sh" | bash
```
**Reminder:** Always check scripts' contents before just piping them into bash!
### Config
When running the script, it will generate a `config` file in the current directory. Fill it out and press enter.
