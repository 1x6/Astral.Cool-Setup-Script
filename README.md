# Astral.Cool Setup Script

A simple Astral.Cool setup script for your skid image hosting.

## Installation

> First, When we get a new server you always want to update your packages using this command. ```sudo apt update```

> Then, When you finish updating your packages. We then upgrade using this command. ```sudo apt upgrade```

> Now you can sign up or login to your cloudflare account and setup this guide [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20210710033022/https://setup.elixr.host/cloudflare-setup/untitled) firstly.

> You can either download the files manually or git clone them. (I recommend git for faster downloading of the files to your server.)

> If you get the error when running git, make sure it's installed by running the command: ```sudo apt install git```

> Then do - ```git clone https://github.com/CourtesyDev/Astral.Cool-Setup-Script.git```

> Once you have got the setup script in the directory you want it at and then we can move to the bash running the setup script.

> Final step, Just do ```bash setup.sh``` to run it. ```(NOTE: If this tutorial helped your brain cells even more, Please star it.)```
